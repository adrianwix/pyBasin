class UnboundednessClusterer(ClustererPredictor):
    """
    Meta-clusterer for separately labeling unbounded trajectories.

    This meta-clusterer wraps another ClustererPredictor and handles unbounded trajectories
    separately. Unbounded trajectories are identified using a detector function and assigned
    a special label, while bounded trajectories are processed using the wrapped clusterer.

    This is particularly useful in basin stability calculations where some trajectories
    may diverge to infinity (e.g., in the Lorenz system). By excluding unbounded trajectories
    from clustering, the wrapped clusterer can focus on discovering patterns in bounded basins
    without contamination from divergent trajectories.

    Example usage:

    ```python
    from pybasin.predictors.unboundedness_clusterer import UnboundednessClusterer
    from pybasin.predictors.hdbscan_clusterer import HDBSCANClusterer
    import numpy as np

    # Create features with some unbounded samples
    features = np.random.randn(100, 10)
    features[0, :] = np.inf  # Unbounded sample
    features[1, :] = 1e10  # Unbounded sample

    # Wrap HDBSCAN with unboundedness handling
    base_clusterer = HDBSCANClusterer(min_cluster_size=5)
    clusterer = UnboundednessClusterer(base_clusterer)
    labels = clusterer.predict_labels(features)
    print(f"Unbounded samples: {np.sum(labels == 'unbounded')}")
    ```

    Notes:

    - Only bounded samples are passed to the wrapped clusterer for clustering
    - The unbounded label is automatically tracked and returned for unbounded samples
    - If all samples are unbounded, all labels will be the unbounded label
    - This prevents unbounded trajectories from distorting cluster centroids and boundaries

    :ivar unbounded_detector: Function used to detect unbounded trajectories.
